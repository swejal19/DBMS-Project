VaxTrack is a database management system (DBMS) project designed to help users track their vaccination details efficiently. The system allows users to register, log in, and store their vaccine records, including vaccine names, dates, dose numbers, and status. It ensures easy access to vaccination history and helps users stay updated on pending doses.
